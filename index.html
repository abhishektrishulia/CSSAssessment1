        <br>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li>

        <i>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways</i>
    </h2>
    <ul class="uList">
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS files</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However,
            <b class="yText">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,
            </b>
            because this is easier to
            demonstrate and easier for you to try it yourself.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para">
        When comparing CSS class vs ID, the different is that CSS class applied a style to
        multiple elements ID in the other hand, applies a style to one unique elements. ID is also special in that you
        can a special URL to link directly to an elements and it's used by JavaScript. </p>

    <p class="para">
        In CSS, selectors CSS are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element
        has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element
    </p>
    <p class="para">
        There is a wide range of selectors avcailable. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to
        target elements to which a style should be applied.
